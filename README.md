# Technology Stack:

- Node/Express
- Firebase authentication
- Cloud Run for frontend and APIs
- Mongo Atlas for database

# Features:

Currently, only basic functionality is displayed for a standing bank account user.

Future features could include an analytics dashboard for each user to see how they are tracking on their monthly spending vs funds. It is also only a single bank account type so far. A future feature could be a savings account accruing interest paid monthly and added to a user's balance.
